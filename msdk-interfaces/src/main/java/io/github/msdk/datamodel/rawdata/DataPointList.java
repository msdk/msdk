 * of data points in mass spectra. Internally, it is implemented by two arrays,
 * one for m/z values (double[]) and one for intensity values (float[]). The
 * arrays are resized dynamically, as in ArrayList. It provides all List
 * methods, therefore it supports iteration. Furthermore, it provides direct
 * access to the underlying buffer arrays, for more efficient data handling
 * operations. The access through these arrays is always preferred, as iteration
 * via the List interface has to create a new DataPoint instance for each
 * visited data point. DataPointList always keeps the data points sorted in the
 * m/z order.
 * 
 * This data structure is not thread-safe.
